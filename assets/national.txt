Someone once asked me: "If you have a lot of money, what would you do?". My answer is that I will travel around the world. Especially where I want to be American. The United States renowned for the most modern cities such as New York, Los angeles, ... and I want to be once you arrive here.  Another reason that makes me want to visit the United States by the cinematic appeal of this place. The films produced by Hollywood, especially action films really attracted me.
It is possible with the current conditions, the U.S.A is a step too far for me to make sure I will later visited America. America the beautiful country wait for me okay...
