Grandmother is house at the top of the village, next to the lotus pond more than three acres. In March, the lake surface is covered with a blue color of the lotus leaf. There are leaves floating on the water, with leaves as high as the green leaf, the stem has many thorns. In early April, lotus blossoms. Pink lotus and white lotus bloom as large as the bowl, full of yellow flowers as well. Walking through the lotus pond, I felt lively, the bag like lotus lot to class.
