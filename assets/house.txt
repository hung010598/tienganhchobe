This is my house. My house has 7 rooms as living room, my parents are the bedroom, my room, the kitchen, the dining room, the bathroom and the toilet. In the living room, you will see the altar Firstly. It is located at a high elevation. In the middle of the room, the table and chairs are located here with chairs and tables (no sofa, no armchair). We have some pictures on the wall above. TVs are located behind tables and chairs. In my room, the computer is located next to the table and the bookshelf is located next to the desk. On the left, the bed is placed near the wardrobe. In the kitchen, the cabinets are placed near the fridge, stove and rice.
