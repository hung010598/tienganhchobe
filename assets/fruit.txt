I like to eat a lot of fruits but I like the mango most. The young mango fruit is green, while the yellow color is dark. On the outside, the mango is a stout hand, thick in the middle and tapering to the sides. Whenever my mother mango, I would love to see two yellow mango cheeks. The very large seed that is in the center makes up about a fifth of the mango tree is mass. It is a dessert that is nutritious and delicious.
